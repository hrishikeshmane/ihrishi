Do you have a Next.js app that you want to share with the world? Do you want to deploy it in minutes without any hassle or configuration? Do you want to enjoy blazing-fast performance, serverless functions, and automatic HTTPS? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you need Vercel.

Vercel is the best way to deploy your Next.js app with zero configuration. Vercel is the company behind Next.js, so they know how to make it shine. Vercel will automatically detect your Next.js app and optimize it for production. You don't need to worry about anything else.

You can deploy your Next.js app to Vercel in two easy ways: using the Vercel CLI or using Vercel for Git. Let me show you how.

## Using the Vercel CLI

The Vercel CLI is a command-line tool that lets you deploy your Next.js app with a single command: vercel. You just need to install it first:

```
npm i -g vercel
```

Then, go to your Next.js project folder and run:

```
vercel
```

That's it! Your app will be deployed to a unique URL like nextjs.vercel.app. You can also add a custom domain of your choice later.

## Using Vercel for Git

Vercel for Git is an integration that lets you connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository with Vercel. This way, every time you push code to your repo, Vercel will automatically deploy it for you. You also get instant previews for every pull request and merge request.

To use Vercel for Git, you just need to import your Next.js project into Vercel. You can do this from the dashboard or from this link: https://vercel.com/import/git

Vercel will ask you to select your git provider and authorize access to your repo. Then, it will detect that you are using Next.js and enable the correct settings for your deployment. You can also configure some options like environment variables and domains.

Once you import your project, every push will trigger a new deployment. Your app will be deployed to a unique URL like nextjs.vercel.app.

That's all there is to it! Deploying a Next.js app on Vercel is super easy and fun. You get all the benefits of Next.js without any of the headaches of hosting and scaling. Try it out today and see for yourself!
